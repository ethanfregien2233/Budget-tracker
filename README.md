## Description 
Budget tracker is an application that will allow the user to add or subtract expenses and deposits to their budget both online and offline. If transactions are entered offline, the changes will be shown when the application goes back online. IndexDB, Service workers, and Web Manifest are all used for offline functionality and the application is deployed on Heroku. (Note: Heroku application is now fully functional, however has errors. For some reason I had to create a brand new heroku app for it to work)
